# hello-world
Hello GitHub. I'm new to the programming scene and dont really know much of anything when it comes to programming. Only code I ever really messed with was on Tumblr messing with my blog ha.
Currently in the Military, not really a tech job but looking into getting into it once I get out.
hoping to pick some good habits up while I can, want to study Computer Science when I get out.
Open to any type of advice negative or positive. I can take criticism. Have a good one ladies and gents.
